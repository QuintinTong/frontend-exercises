# CSS Animation

Recreate the `demo.m4v` video using the assets provided.

## Requirements

- The animation should be powered by CSS3. Only worry about -webkit properties, not other vendors.
- Use the `-webkit-mask` property.
- Use jQuery to handle the click event that triggers the animation.
- Don't worry about getting the timing or keyframes exactly right...just make them close enough to the video.
