# Lift Exercises

Each exercise contains a README and the files needed to complete the task. Complete all the exercises to the best of your ability; if you have no idea, spend a few minutes and try to figure it out. We'll be looking at your work in Chrome, so just use `-webkit` prefixes for CSS properties that are not fully supported yet.

When you're complete, ZIP all your work into a single file and send them to [micah@liftinteractive.com](mailto:micah@liftinteractive.com).
